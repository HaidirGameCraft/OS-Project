# OS PROJECT

welcome to OS PROJECT. This is my os project that I started before enrolling in colleague.

# Install
```sh
git clone https://github.com/HaidirGameCraft/OS-Project.git
cd OS-Project
```

Before running make command, make sure you need to disassembly all USB that attach on loop0 and required SUDO or PERMISSION because this command need your loop0 dev to build the FileSystem ( On other Time, I will make non SUDO and loop0 attach)

```sh
make
```
